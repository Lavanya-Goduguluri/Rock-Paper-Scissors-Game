# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
This C++ program simulates a **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game between a player and AI. The player selects an option, and the AI randomly chooses one. The program compares choices, declares a winner, or repeats in case of a draw. Using rand(), it ensures randomness, making each round unpredictable. The loop continues until there is a decisive winner.
